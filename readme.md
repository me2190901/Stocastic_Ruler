The main file for stochastic ruler method is facility_location.py file. The input format is also given in the file.

For the p-median problem the file p_median.py is the main file where you have to set the parameters for different distributions.

For generation of bimodal data we have made a master file named data_generator.py which would generate all the data for the distributions given in it.

The results are present in .csv files.

We have also implemented bimodal distribution for sampling which is implemented in bimodal.py.

All the other files are for different problems done by us during the project such as relaxed stochastic ruler method and numerical examples.

For any clarification write down to us on.
